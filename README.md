# Restaurant Sales SQL Project

This project showcases a full workflow from dirty data to SQL analytics. I cleaned a raw CSV of restaurant orders, imported it into SQLite, and wrote queries to extract insights about sales performance.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

- Removed missing and duplicate rows
- Fixed inconsistent casing in `Item` column
- Ensured numeric consistency in `Quantity` and `Price` fields

---

## 📊 SQL Queries & Insights

- **Total Revenue:** Overall earnings from all items sold  
- **Revenue by Item:** Top-grossing menu items  
- **Most Ordered Item:** Highest demand item based on quantity  
- **Daily Revenue:** Day-by-day revenue breakdown  

All queries written and tested in DB Browser for SQLite, saved in [`queries.sql`](./queries.sql).

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Excel (for data cleaning)
- SQLite + DB Browser for SQLite
- Visual Studio Code (for SQL + Markdown)
- GitHub (to share portfolio)
